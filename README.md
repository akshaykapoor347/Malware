# Malware detection using Machine learning
Malware, or malicious software, is any program or file that is harmful to a computer user. Malware includes computer viruses, worms, Trojan horses and spyware. These malicious programs can perform a variety of functions, including stealing, encrypting or deleting sensitive data, altering or hijacking core computing functions and monitoring users' computer activity without their permission. Once a machine is infected by malware, criminals can hurt consumers and enterprises in many ways. Cybercrimes have been increasing and the global cost of cybercrime has now reached as much as 600 billion dollars — about 0.8 percent of global GDP. 

To minimize risk, is it possible to predict the chance of machine getting infected using machine learning?
